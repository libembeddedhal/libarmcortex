# API

The following chapter contains detailed API documentation for every class and 
function in the code base. These descriptions include, but are not limited to,
descriptions of the available classes, their method, what parameters those 
methods take, and a description of those parameters and how to use them. These
sort of descriptions are also available for functions, type definitions, 
structures and inline defined variables within header files.

## Classes

The classes section contains every single documented class in the project. This
area can be quite large and hard to navigate unless you know exactly what you
are looking for. If you are not sure exactly what you are looking for but know
what catagory of library you are looking for, use the modules section.

## Modules

Modules chapter categorizes drivers in like groups which makes navigation 
easier.
