# Design Documentation

This section goes into detail on the design choices of each aspect of each part
of the libembeddedhal library. This section will go into why things are the way
they are. If you are looking to just know how to use aspects of libembeddedhal
please see the "guides" and "api" chapters. 

This section is meant to explain to users of libembeddedhal why certain design 
choices were made, what the alternatives options were, what are the pros and 
cons of a system and why the pros outweigh the cons. If you disagree with these 
design choices, feel free to add an issue to the official repo.
